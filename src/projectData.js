Then each player is asked in turn to place 5 ships on their boards. Then game begins! If single player, the user can keep attacking the enemy board (right-side) and watch the AI hits on his/her own board(left-side). If it's a 2 player game, after each attack the player hides his board so the enemy won't peak, and then passes the screen to the enemy so he/she can attack. Again, each player is shown a friendly and enemy board. Game ends when all ships of a player are sunk!",
