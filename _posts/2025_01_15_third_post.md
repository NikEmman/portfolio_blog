## Web Dev Origins Story (part 2)

\
\
_Deus ex machina_
\
\
As my shifts left me with no standard time to attend a boot camp, I found out about [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). It is a fully fledged open source curriculum, designed to help people become web devs. So around September of 2023, my journey at the hands of Odin begun.
\
\
\
It taught me HTML, CSS, some JavaScript and then moved on to the wonderful Ruby world! Ruby lessons culminated with the [Chess game](https://github.com/NikEmman/Chess), a console version of chess! It felt like climbing mount Olympus... But then, I was done. Continued the learning trek with Ruby on Rails, which ended with building a facebook clone, featuring all my Rails knowledge, I even hosted it on Fly.io, showed it to friends and family.
\
\
\
Here was that feeling again! **_The world was mine_**!
\
\
\
 The world was actually not mine.
\
\
\
I started sending my first applications at that point, but I soon found out how premature that was. After a another round of low, reality sunk in, back to the lessons, more JS, more HTML/CSS and finally React. The curriculum end project was a messaging app, Rails as back end api endpoints, React front end, featuring everything I've learned so far, authorization/authentication, data manipulation, api calls from React, backend / front end unit tests. It felt a bit of double work, but React kinda grew onto me, like an acquired taste.
