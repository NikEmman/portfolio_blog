## Nick the Web Dev, Origins (part 1)

Around 2022 I had a feeling my brain was atrophying, my job wasn't much of an intellectual challenge, so as a way to keep my brain sharp, I started learning programming with C# and Microsoft's [Beginner series](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0QUgvfuKvWU).

_It felt like rain falling on the soil after a summer drought._
\
\
\
After going through the whole thing, following along, I jumped to other youtube teachers, mostly watching other write code, without doing much building on my own.
\

I was knee deep in the dreaded Tutorial Hell, without even knowing at the time, that this was a thing. I eventually found out about Maui, a cross-platform framework to build desktop and mobile apps all in one codebase. Sounded fun so I tried to follow along what the video was even doing or why. A friend then told me of tutorial hell and pointed out "I need to build actual stuff, on my own". Which I did, I actually make a mobile app, my very own, a calculator. Maaaan! What a dopamine hit, **I felt so good, the world was mine!**

### The world was actually not mine

Around that time I became a father and between that and a full time, shift-based job, I was hard pressed to find spare time. But my resolve hardened. The idea entered my head "Programming and building stuff feels so good, could it..Could it become my new job??" In order to try to make this new dream a reality though, I needed to get out of tutorial hell, I needed structured lessons and no aimless wandering around. But what?
